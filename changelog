turnkey-tkldev-17.0 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Upgraded base distribution to Debian 11.1/Bullseye.

  * caching proxy:

    - Switch from Polipo (only cached http and is no longer available in
      Debian) to Squid. Squid is configured as a caching http/https proxy.
      Using 'squid-openssl' package, it is configured to act as a MITM (man in
      the middle) caching proxy - closes #1560.

  * fab:

    - Port code to python3 and major code refactoring.
    - Use new 'turnkey-chroot' library for use in 'fab-chroot'.
    - Use xorriso (instead of genisoimage) for generating ISO. This provides
      UEFI boot support (note this only supports booting the ISO via UEFI;
      additional work in di-live required to complete UEFI install support).
      Part of #1435.
      NOTE: The UEFI support started for v17.0 di-live and ISO builds has been
      (temporarily) rolled back and won't be implemented in v17.0.

  * pool:

    - Port code to python3 and major code refactoring. Closes #1272.
    - (Still not pre-installed by default).

  * bootstrap:

    - Include 'ca-certificates' package (to support https apt repos via squid
      https proxy).

  * corestrap:

    - Support the option of using a "corestrap", rather than a minimalist
      bootstrap. A corestrap is a bootstrap, but with all core packages
      (except the kernel) pre-installed. It is larger than the bootstrap, but
      speeds up builds significantly.

    all appliances. Here we only describe changes specific to this appliance.

turnkey-tkldev-16.1 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * Include debootstrap package by default - closes #1450.

  * Minor tweak to bootstrap generation to provide transition guidance.

    all appliances. Here we only describe changes specific to this appliance.

turnkey-tkldev-16.0 (1) turnkey; urgency=low

  * No longer include pool, chanko and friends by default. tkldev-chanko-setup
    script has been tweaked and some config setup has been moved to package
    postinst scripts.

    TODO: more work is still required to make it possible for users to easily
          build packages. Plus the buildroot repo needs update.

  * fab:

    - major changes to way that the bootstrap is built. Now leverages Debian's
      debootstrap directly (bootstrap components removed from fab, remaining
      changes in turnkey/bootstrap repo).

  * buildtasks:

    - significant refactoring, including inclusion of bt-bootstrap script to
      build bootstrap if relevant bootstrap not currently available.
    - updates to most bt- scripts for Buster.
    - refactoring of bin/signature-verify to support forcing check of hashfile
      GPG signing via '--force-gpg' switch (default behaviour remains unsigned
      files just giving warning).

  * tkldev-setup:

    - refactor to give more meaningful output.
    - change order of repo cloning (now 1st) & bootstrap download (now 2nd).
    - leverage buildtasks/config/common.cfg (fallback to config.example if not
      setup) to set relevant GPG key ID (BT_GPGKEY).
    - leverage buildtasks/bin/signature-verify script to check downloaded
      bootstrap file.

  * Docs:

    - additional development docs now included in build code repo (none
      included in built appliance by default; yet).
    - many docs rewritten and/or improved.
    - many docs still outdated and/or in need of improvement. :(

    appliances. Here we only describe changes specific to this appliance.
